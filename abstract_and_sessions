Programming using Python, GIT and others in science
===================================================


During the past years the use of of Python and other tools originally created
for more traditional type of software programming has become very popular in
the area of data driven science. The scientific Python ecosystem has become
mature quite fast during the past years. Using open source tools makes your
work more accessible to others. This is an important advantage especially in
academia and motivates many to the transition from commercial software like
Matlab, Maple or Mathematica to Python and the libraries available.

We will try to answer questions, which might be interesting for scientists
working with data. With a focus on practical tasks, we want study how to write
good, efficient code and which tools to use to organize our data and the code.
If helpful for understanding the big picture, we will discuss a bit of theory.

Prerequisites:
- basic understanding of (scripted) programing languages (loops, variables,
functions, classes, ...)
- knowledge of basic Python syntax (e.g. implement easy functions, importing
  modules, ...)
- basic GIT knowledge
- use of a command line
